test the use of user.name and user.email of git:

1. set valid name, valid email, can get committer. 
2. set invalid name, valid email, can get committer.
3. set valid name, invalid email, cann't get committer.
4. set invalid name, invalid email, cann't get committer.
So must set a valid email before you commit a change.
